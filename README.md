TTS_Generator
A tool or system that converts written text into spoken words using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. It processes textual input and generates natural-sounding audio output, often used in applications like voice assistants, accessibility tools, and automated announcements.
This project used daswer123's repository, with text as input and my generated voice as output. During training, my voice file sliced ​​with the training data as "whisper-medium model" was entered as data.
